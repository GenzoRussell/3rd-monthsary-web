        <h2>HAPPY 3RD MONTHSARY LOVE!</h2>
        <p>
          Hello love!^^ we're already in 3 months of love It might not be aiming very high, pero itâ€™s everything to me right now. It's been three months of fun, late-night talks, and love. and yes, we have a few fights where both of us say plenty of words pero it never took us down. Despite sa challenges natin love, we have persevered and continue to choose each other every day. I mean, I know weâ€™ve also had moments where things got a little messy, where emotions running a little too high, and we both had to take a cool-off and yet I never considered those reasons to quit. I considered them as evidence that we care enough to struggle. But my love for you has only grown stronger as a result of our arguments. I need you to know on how grateful I am forâ€‚you love and for the love you have for me and for the person you are. I know I see how hardâ€‚you doings every single day. Even if kapag pagod ka sa ginagawa mo, kapag na busy ka ginagawa mo, and even if wala ka sa mood lately, you still find time to love me. That does not go unnoticed or unappreciated, and I do not take any of it for granted. Pero when Iâ€™m withâ€‚you, I feel home. You makeâ€‚the world a little softer, a little brighter, and a lot more meaningful and no matter what comes our way, Iâ€™ll always choose to stand by your side, to learn with you, to grow with you and to love you in all the ways I can. Love? thankâ€‚you for being my person. for loving meâ€‚including sa mga araw na I had a hard time loving myself. Iâ€™mâ€‚grateful to have you love and for every weeks, months, and years will love you unconditionally. I love you completely, deeply, and endlessly love and for internity once again,
          Happy monthsary, loveðŸ’—
